# VESICLE-CNN-2 example

This folder contains all the datafiles and logs for investigating the VCNN-2 classifier presented in the included paper.
This code is the dev code and differs from the main code that in the main repo (which is live) and should only be used for verification of the results in the paper.
In the original log file, the timings were a bit off, and hence updated timing logs are included in the timing\_validation file. 
Further verification of the reproducibility of the results are included in accuracy\_validation where we re-applied the trained classifier to the same dataset.
